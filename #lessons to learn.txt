use == or ===, never = for checks

remember to use i++ in for looops to increment

use + to string stuff together in document.write

always remember to close brackets

use ; instead of , in for loops

i<x.length is the same as i<=x.length-1

define numbers as var

use array[i] instead of just i if necessary

use !== instead of ==!

rather than nest for loops, use functions

you can't use numbers alongside "length", so you have to put it "toString()"

always remember to return at the end of your function if you want it to do anything

be consistent with semicolons

use arrow function syntax

don't shorten variable names
